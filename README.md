## About
Forked from https://github.com/welefen/KeymapManager

KeymapManager plugin can manage all plugins keymap what both default and user installed.

## How to use
view -> Keymap Manager or ctrl+alt+K
A list of commands will show up with their shortcut keys, so you don't need to open the keymap files to learn them.
